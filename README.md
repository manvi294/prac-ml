Second project has 2 key components, the first one is a program which validates a version of sample JSON data against a schema setup by SEDA team. This program will alert when data doesn't follows desired format, and sends back a business object for valid sample data.
Second component is about creation of a utility where at real time, XML upo gets converted to json and vice versa on the fly with the help of mapping sheet.
