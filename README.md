Learning 
The entire journey was a similar to a  roller coaster, 
 
Coming to the technical part, learning with springboot, building the gradle file, setting up before we begin was some part we were scared and struggled a lot but now it's a peice of cake 

Debugging skills of all of us had really improved by 4 timew.

You know the greatest thing wasss
Learning how to keep things secure.
The strict  bank protocols
Work on a remote control 

another great thing was learning about financial messages formats, and learning about enomrous java libraries for manipulation, understanding of schema, their use and so on.

Freedom to talk to different leaders gave us an excellent corporate insights , smtg we never expected.



Thankyou for this amazing opportunity and making our expirience awesome
